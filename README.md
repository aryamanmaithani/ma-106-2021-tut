# Recaps

Week 2:
1. Recall REF. n variables, r pivots ⇒ (n - r) free variables
2. Ax = 0 has only the zero solution ⇔ n = r
3. GEM
4. Ax = 0 has only the zero solution ⇔ any REF of A has n non-zero rows
5. Inverse
6. Ax = 0 has only the zero solution ⇔ A is invertible
7. Let A, B ∈ ℝ^{n × n}. AB = I ⇔ BA = I 
8. RCF. REF + pivots are 1 + the entries above the pivots are 0s
9. A can be transformed to I via EROs ⇔ A is invertible
10. GJM
11. Linear (in)dependence
12. Row rank
13. Given n column vectors, make a matrix with those as columns and find its row rank r. 
We know r ≤ n. The vectors are linearly independent ⇔ r = n.
14. EROs don't change row rank. Thus, A and REF(A) have the same row rank.
If A' is in REF, then row-rank(A') = number-of-non-zero-rows(A').
